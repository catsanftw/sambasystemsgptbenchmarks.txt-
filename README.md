Introduction
The Samba Systems GPT Benchmarks project aims to provide a standardized and transparent way to evaluate the performance of different GPT models. By using a consistent set of benchmarks, we can compare models and track improvements over time.

Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/catsanftw/sambasystemsgptbenchmarks.txt.git
cd sambasystemsgptbenchmarks.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
To run the benchmarks, use the following command:

python run_benchmarks.py

This will execute all the benchmark tests and generate a report with the results.

Benchmark Tests
The benchmark tests cover a variety of tasks, including:

Text generation
Text completion
Question answering
Summarization
Translation
Each test is designed to evaluate different aspects of the GPT models’ performance, such as accuracy, speed, and resource usage.

Results
The results of the benchmark tests are stored in the results directory. Each test generates a detailed report with metrics and visualizations to help analyze the performance of the models.

Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community! If you have ideas for new benchmark tests or improvements to the existing ones, please submit a pull request. Make sure to follow our contributing guidelines.
